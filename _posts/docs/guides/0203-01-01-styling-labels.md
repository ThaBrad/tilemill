## Basic Point Labels

In CartoCSS, labelling is handled by a variety of properties beginning with `text-`. For each text-related style there are two required properties: `text-name`, which specifies what text goes in the labels, and `text-face-name`, which specifies the typeface(s) will be used to draw the label. (You can see which typefaces are available in the font browser - click the 'A' icon on the left button bar.)

The `text-name` property can pull text from your layer's data fields. If your layer contains a column called `NAME`, a simple label style would look like this:

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-1.png' class='fig-right' />

    #cities {
      text-name: [NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
    }


The color and size of these labels will be the defaults - black and 10 pixels respectively. These can be adjusted with the `text-fill` and `text-size` properties.

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-2.png' class='fig-right' />

    #cities {
      text-name: [NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-fill: #036;
      text-size: 20;
    }

To separate your text from the background, it is often useful to add an outline or _halo_ around the text. You can control the color with `text-halo-fill` and the width of the halo (in pixels) is controlled with `text-halo-radius`. In the example below, we are using the `fadeout` color function to make the white halo 30% transparent.

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-3.png' class='fig-right' />

    #cities {
      text-name: [NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-fill: #036;
      text-size: 20;
      text-halo-fill: fadeout(white, 30%);
      text-halo-radius: 2.5;
    }

## Text Along Lines

You can also use CartoCSS to style labels that follow a line such as a road or a river. To do this we need to adjust the `text-placement` property. Its default is `point`; we'll change it to `line`. We've also added a simple style to visualize the line itself.

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-4.png' class='fig-right' />

    #rivers {
      line-color: #85c5d3;
      text-name: [NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-fill: #036;
      text-size: 20;
      text-placement: line;
    }

For rivers it is nice to have the label offset parallel to the line of the river. This can be easily done with the `text-dy` property to specify how large (in pixels) this offset should be. (`dy` refers to a <b>d</b>isplacement along the __y__ axis.)

We'll also adjust the `text-max-char-angle-delta` property. This allows us to specify the maximum line angle (in degrees) that the text should try to wrap around. The default is 22.5°; setting it lower will make the labels appear along straighter parts of the line.

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-5.png' class='fig-right' />

    #rivers {
      line-color: #85c5d3;
      text-name: [NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-fill: #036;
      text-size: 20;
      text-placement: line;
      text-dy: 12;
      text-max-char-angle-delta: 15;
    }

## Adding custom text

Labels aren't limited to pulling text from just one column. You can combine data from many columns as well as arbitrary text to construct your `text-name`. For example you could include the state/province separated by a comma and a space.

    #cities {
      text-name: [NAME] + ', ' + [ADM1NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-size: 20;
    }

Other potential uses:

- Multilingual labels: `[name] + '(' + [name_en] + ')'`
- Numeric units: `[elevation] + 'm'`
- Clever [unicode icons](http://copypastecharacter.com/symbols): `'⚑ ' + [embassy_name]` or `'⚓ ' + [harbour_name]`

You can also assign arbitrary text to labels that does not come from a data field. Due to a backwards-compatibility issue, you will need to quote such text twice for this to work correctly.

    #parks {
      text-name: "'Park'";
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
    }

If you need to include quotation marks in your custom quoted text, you will need to *escape* them with a backslash. For example, for the custom text **City's "Best" Coffee**:

    text-name: "'City\'s \"Best\" Coffee'";

## Multi-line labels

You can wrap long labels onto multiple lines with the `text-wrap-width` property which specifies at what pixel width labels should start wrapping. By default the first word that crosses the wrap-width threshold will not wrap - to change this you can set `text-wrap-before` to `true`.

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-6.png' class='fig-right' />

    #cities {
      text-name: [NAME] + ', ' + [ADM1NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-size: 20;
      text-wrap-width: 100;
      text-wrap-before: true;
    }

Note that text wrapping not yet supported with `text-placement: line`.

You may have a specific point where you want the line breaks to happen. You can use the `text-wrap-character` to cause labels to wrap on a character other than a space. With a properly constructed dataset this can give you better control over your labels.

For example we could alter our compound label example to separate the two fields only with an underscore. Setting the wrap character to `_` (and also setting a very low wrap width to force wrapping) ensures that the two fields will always be written on their own lines.

<img src='/tilemill/assets/pages/styling-labels-7.png' class='fig-right' />

    #cities {
      text-name: [NAME] + '_' + [ADM1NAME];
      text-face-name: 'Droid Sans Regular';
      text-size: 20;
      text-wrap-width: 1;
      text-wrap-character: '_';
    }

## Layering Labels

If you are applying label styles to layers that also have line or polygon styles you might notice some unexpected overlapping where the labels aren't necessarily on top.

For simple stylesheets you can control this by making sure your geometry styles and your text styles are in separate attachments:

    #layer {
      ::shape {
        polygon-fill: #ace;
        line-color: #68a;
      }
      ::label {
        text-name: [name];
        text-face-name: 'Arial Regular';
      }
    }

However in many cases you'll need to create a label layer that is separate from the layer you use for line and polygon styling. As an example of this, you can look at the _Open Streets DC_ project that comes with TileMill.

The layers `roads` and `roads-label` reference the same data, but are separated for correct ordering. For more details on how object stacking works in TileMill, see the [Symbol Drawing Order](/tilemill/docs/guides/symbol-drawing-order/) guide.
