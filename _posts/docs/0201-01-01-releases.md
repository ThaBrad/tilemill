### Past releases and development builds

Mac builds use a `.zip` extension while Windows builds use a `.exe` extension.

### Development build naming

Development build names use the output of `git describe` so a file named `TileMill-v0.10.1-59-g338d40a` means it is `59` commits after the previous `0.10.1` release and the most recent commit is git revision `338d40a` which can be accessed at [https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill/commit/338d40a](https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill/commit/338d40a).
